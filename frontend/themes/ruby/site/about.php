                        <p>LAMP & LEMP Developer (+15 years): more than 15 years activity in using LEMP/LAMP stack has made me a solid developer in this area. I’m quite good at *unix (debian based) servers.</p>
                        <div class="vertec-list-content">
                            <ol>
                                <li>I’ve grown up with <span>PHP</span> :) and during the past 15 years I've had a lot of fun with it. I’ve been using <span>Yii Framework</span> since 2009 and I love it!</li>
                                <li>Since 2010 I've switched all my servers to <span>Nginx</span> and during these years I've learned how to tweak a Linux (<span>Debian</span> based) OS and Nginx configuration to have a highly reliable, tuned and hardened web server for different applications and purposes.</li>
                                <li><span>MySQL</span> is my main choice over all other <span>RDBMS</span>. Although tweaking innodb configuration on the latest <span>Percona</span> build of MySQL help me to use the highest possible power of this great database but I know the limits as well and usually combine it with a <span>Redis</span> to build up a trustworthy fast DB storage. Redis is also usually my main choice for cache/session storage and I almost use it in every project that I have been developed during past 4 years.</li>
                                <li><span>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</span> is my favorite cloud service and I use their services almost every day. I know <span>EC2</span>, <span>Elastic Beanstalk</span>, <span>S3</span>, <span>CloudFront</span>, <span>EBS</span>, <span>RDS</span>, <span>DynamoDB</span>, <span>ElastiCache</span>, <span>Route 53</span>, <span>Identity & Access Management</span>, <span>SNS</span>, <span>SQS</span> and <span>AWS SDK for PHP</span>.</li>
                                <li><span>RabbitMQ</span> and ZeroMQ</span> play the main role in the queue/worker tasks.</li>
                                <li><span>REST API</span> is the thing that I've been working on for the past 3 years in <span>Thank You Menu, Inc</span>. We develop a fast and reliable RESTful API for our web/mobile apps.</li>
                                <li><span>Node.js</span> is my alternative when I need something lighter and faster to work with as a back-end environment I try to use it as less as possible because I don’t like <span>Javascript</span> too much :-/ but sometimes it was the solution and I’m really happy with it’s results.</li>
                                <li>Sometime I use <span>backbone.js</span>, <span>handlebars.js</span>, <span>require.js</span>, and most of the time <span>jQuery</span> for some front-end tasks and <span>HTML/CSS</span> are also used in some moments in my day to day life.</li>
                                <li><span>Parse.com</span> has been a part of my life for the past 2 years. I’ve developed 3 different applications with it and know their JS SDK, PHP SDK and back-end semi-node environments as well.</li>
