                            <p><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Since 2010 I've switched all my servers to Nginx and during these years I've learned how to tweak a Linux (Debian based) OS and Nginx configuration to have a highly reliable, tuned and hardened web server for different applications and purposes.</p>
                            <p><i class="fa fa-check"></i> MySQL is my main choice over all other RDBMS. Although tweaking innodb configuration on the latest Percona build of MySQL help me to use the highest possible power of this great database but I know the limits as well and usually combine it with a Redis to build up a trustworthy fast DB storage. Redis is also usually my main choice for cache/session storage and I almost use it in every project that I have been developed during past 4 years.</p>
                            <p><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Amazon Web Services (AWS) is my favorite cloud service and I use their services almost every day. I know EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, S3, CloudFront, EBS, RDS, DynamoDB, ElastiCache, Route 53, Identity & Access Management, SNS, SQS and AWS SDK for PHP.</p>

                            <p><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Sometime I use backbone.js, handlebars.js, require.js, and most of the time  jQuery for some front-end tasks and HTML/CSS are also used in some moments in my day to day life.</p>
